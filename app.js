Exercise 12: FizzBuzz with arrays

1) Choose a method to iterate through the `nums` array.

   - Push any number evenly divisible by 5 to an array called `buzz`.
   - Push any number that is evenly divisible by 3 and 5 to an array called
     `fizzbuzz`.

   Note: A single number may meet more than one of the above rules. If it does,
         it should be placed in multiple arrays. For example, the number `15`
         will appear in the `fizz`, `buzz`, and `fizzbuzz` arrays.
